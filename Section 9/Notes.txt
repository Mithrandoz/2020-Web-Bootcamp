-watched lesson 125
-reviewed RNG (random number generation) and it's javascript function

-watched lesson 126
-reviewed conditionals ('if' and 'else' statements)

-watched lesson 127
-reviewed comparators and the different types of equality

-watched lesson 128
-reviewed how to combine comparators

-completed Coding Exercise 5 
-create an advanced BMI Calculator that gives different output based on the user's BMI
Solution:

function bmiCalculator (weight, height) {
    var bmi = weight / (height * height);
    if(bmi > 24.9){It wa
    var interpretation = ("Your BMI is " + bmi + ", so you are overweight.");
} 
    if(bmi < 18.5) {
    var interpretation = ("Your BMI is " + bmi + ", so you are underweight.");
}
    if(bmi >= 18.5 && bmi <= 24.9) {
    var interpretation = ("Your BMI is " + bmi + ", so you have a normal weight.");
}
    return interpretation;
}

-watched lesson 129
-explaination of the next challenge and the consept of a leap year (for people who didn't know, lol)

-completed Coding Exercise 7
-create a program that will tell you if a year(input) is a leap year based on the rules for leap years:
-A year is a leap year if it is evenly divisible by 4
-Except if that year is also evenly divisible by 100
-Unless that year is also evenly divisible by 400

Solution:

function isLeap(year) {
    
    if(year % 4 === 0){
        if(year % 100 === 0){
            if(year % 400 === 0){
                return("Leap year.")
            } else{
                return("Not leap year.")
            }
        } else{
            return("Leap year.")
        }
    } else{
        return("Not leap year.")
    }

}

-used the remainder function as if it wasn't divisible by a number there would be a remainder

-watched lesson 130
-reviewed leap year solution

-watched lesson 131
-reviewed arrays
