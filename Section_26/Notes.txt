-mongodb has been updated since this lesson, nothing is the same
-mongodb keeps refering to creating "clusters" and using "atlas"
-none of that is covered and I have no idea what it means even after looking it up

-mongos are app server routers, clusters contain shards, shards contain replica sets.
-shards are groups of servers for one database cluster separated for quick and easy access.
-what if I don't want to use Atlas and keep things local?
